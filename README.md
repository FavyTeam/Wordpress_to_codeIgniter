  Duplicate Staff Member Functionality to Code igniter


# Description

We need this job done by Wednesday Dec 20th at latest.

Hello, we have a wordpress website. We are currently using a Staff Directory plugin, and login to wordpress to manage those staff members.

We no longer want to login into wordpress, we actually want to copy the same ability we have now in wordpress to add staff members, but copy this into our Code Ingiter internal system.

So basically, we want to copy / clone ability in 3 section , make clone into our code igniter software. We will have it post to same wordpress DB, but we want to manage content in our internet software.

So manage content inside our software, but display content still in wordpress.

 - MS SQL via the mssql, sqlsrv (version 2005 and above only) and pdo drivers

 - CUBRID via the cubrid and pdo drivers
 - Interbase/Firebird via the ibase and pdo drivers
